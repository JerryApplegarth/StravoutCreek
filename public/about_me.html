						Hi there! My name is Jerry Applegarth and welcome to my
						mining site.
					</h2>

					<p class="text1">
						The year was 2002 when this 79 acre claim became
						available to file on as a mining claim.
					</p>

					<p class="text2">
						I had been doing recreational prospecting all my life.
						It's something that has been a great interest to me. I
						obtained the claim and have been doing recreational
						mining ever since that day.
					</p>

					<h3>Summer Mining</h3>
					<p>
						Because this is a family recreational event for us and
						the fact that BLM prefers that we mine only durning the
						summer months, our mining usually run from May through
						September. This is because during the fall and winter
						months fish need the waters to be very clean for
						reproduction.
					</p>
					<p>
						We only go to the claim on weekends and long holidays
						during the summer months. This claim is a 'placer
						claim', meaning that we are working the gravel bars for
						gold that has been washed downstream in the creek.
					</p>
					<h3>Nuggets</h3>
					<p>
						Most gold that is found in any placer claim are smaller
						pieces often less than one gram. Sometimes you get lucky
						and find bigger pieces but not often.
					</p>
					<p>
						Below are some examples of of very lucky finds that we
						made on the claim.
					</p>
					<p>
						The troy ounce is a metic system used in weighing
						precious metals. The troy ounce is the equivalent of
						31.1034768 grams. A standard ounce is the equivalent of
						28.349 grams, or around 10% less.

					<h3>Small Nuggets and Pickers</h3>
					<p>
						Here are some smaller pieces with a the some weighing
						about 30 grams. Notice how rough the pieces are, that
						means they have moved only a little distance downstream
						from the source.

					<h3>Two Large Nuggets</h3>
					<p>
						The nugget on the right weights in at 61 grams. It had a
						piece broken off from the tractor digging it from the
						ground. The broken piece weighted 2 grams. Our largest
						nugget.

					<h3>Gold in Quartz</h3>
					<p>
						This is my favorite nugget, it weighted about 35 grams.
						It is a piece of quartz with gold running all through
						the piece. It is smooth from it's history of being moved
						down by the stream.
